Using analytic expression for escape velocity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity

v_e = sqrt(2GM/r) which reduces to v_e = sqrt(2G) in astronomical units.
Analytical value for earth 8.88577 AU/yr

Setting N high =100000, t_max = 1

Base value of initial velocity v_x0 = 2*pi

v_0 = 2pi + 1 = 7.28319 
run gives

v_0 = 2pi+2.0 = 8.28319
run gives

for the same v_0 increase t_max = 5 in order to see trajectory more clearly
run gives

trajectory suggests orbit still closed.

v_0 = 2pi + 2.5 = 8.78319 (close to analytical value)
t_max = 10
run gives

t_max must be increased alot since radii of orbit is getting larger
for same v_0 t_max = 60
run gives
vesttest3.1.png
orbit still closed.

(!!!Successfull!!!)
v_0 = 2pi+2.6 = 8.88319
t_max = 60
run gives

numerical escape velocity reached

Deviation from analytical ~10^{-2} by taking difference.
Still, numerical value lower than analytical (expected), due to low N? Increasing N to 10000000 (two orders higher) shows no change,
orbit still not closed.
