In Abstract:
  Include main findings (from concluions) - supplemented by a summary of the partiulars: for example "Verlet superior" supplemented by "with
  an error margin of 1e-6 for N=1000 integrations points)
  
In Introduction:
  Include structure:
    In which order are things done. "under "algo implment", the details of implemeting algo into code is covered" - with link to algo implt section
    Main findings (like in abstract) - but with more detail
    Tools used (when critical in order to reproduce results): for example c++ with armadillo, and why this tool is used (c++ for optimiation and minimizing cycles)
    Motivation: Why is the report covering what it is?

In methods:
  Under kodeimplementasjon - gi detaljer om innledende tester av algoritme: gir den riktige svar? 
  Catch for Ã¥ iverate integritet

In conclusions:
  Future prospects: due to the following discrepencies, example "not checking conservaton o momentum", further testnig should b done implementing "some test".
