Wikipedia page for analytical escape velocity
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity

using expression v_e = sqrt(2GM/r)
reducing to v_e = sqrt(2G) when r=1AU, and GM = 4pi^2
giving analytical escape velocity for sun earth system 8.88577 AU/yr

program force function modified to calculate force with default beta=2 which can be run for different beta.
choosing N = 100000 and t_max = 1
starting test for
Earth_v_y0 =  2*pi;
gives known result

same plot

and increasing 

Earth_v_y0 =  2*pi+1;
gives
